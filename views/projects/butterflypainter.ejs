				<h3>Butterfly Painter</h3>
				<h5 class="projectLink">Due for installation at the <a href="http://www.wildlifeoasis.co.uk">Lakeland Wildlife Oasis</a> later in 2017</h5>
				<p>An interactive, animated 3D installation for a zoo visitor centre in Cumbria.</p>
				<p>Visitors to the zoo encounter this installation in a softly lit room just before they enter the zoo's tropical butterfly hall. A rainforest scene is projected onto a wall, in which a number of animated butterflies fly about.</p>

				<p>Nearby, they find a wall-mounted touchscreen, displaying the screen below, with which a visitor can 'finger paint' onto a cutout representation of a butterfly's wing using basic paint controls and colour-picking palettes.<p>

				<p>When they have finished colouring in their wing, they hit the 'finish' button to see an animated 3D version of their butterfly fly into the scene being projected onto the wall, joining the others.</p>
				<p>The program will maintain a specified number of butterflies - about 10 seems to work best - with each new addition replacing the 'oldest' butterfly in the scene (which will fly out of shot before being erased).</p>

				<p>Behind the scenes, the program flow works like this:</p>

					<li>The touch-screen paint 'app' is simply built in <span class="spanTech spanHTML">HTML</span> and <span class="spanTech spanLanguage">jQuery</span>, using a <span class="spanTech spanHTML">Canvas</span> element shaped by a series of quadratic curves to define the wing template.</li>
					<li>The projected 'scene' in which the butterflies are flying is a rudimentary <a href="https://unity3d.com/"><span class="spanTech spanLanguage">Unity3D</span></a> application, with a static rainforest image at the far end of an invisible 3D 'boundary box' within which the butterflies are constrained.</li>
					<li>The butterfly model was adapted from a <a href="https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/blue-butterfly-3ds-free/607415">freely available model</a>, using </li>
					<li>When a new wing is saved by a user, a .png file is saved to the browser's default download directory.</li>
